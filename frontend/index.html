                    <p>In addition to working as a Cyber Security Engineer, I relish spending time outdoors, mainly due to my two sons. Both of them are active in youth sports, which makes me a coach, and mentor for 10 months each year. Our family also includes two rescue dogs, so you can only imagine the lively atmosphere in our home on a daily basis! Similar to many fathers, I have a teenage daughter who I typically see during dinner and car rides to various places. As such, one of my favorite pastimes is playfully intruding into her space and dancing around her friends to engage with her.  </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When confined indoors, I enjoy watching a variety of shows on HGTV as well as comedy movies and television series.I dedicate a portion of my free time to staying updated on the latest advancements in front-end web development, cybersecurity, AI/ML, and the cloud computing world.</p>
